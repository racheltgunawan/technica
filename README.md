# Technica Hackathon Project 2021 - Origns of Hate Tweets
In the 2021 Technica Hackathon, I decided to make my project about visualizing data based on the origin of hate tweets. 

It was my first time learning about data visualization in python, specifically the use of *pandas*, *geopandas*, and *geoplots*. 
Additionally, I had never worked with .csv's before in python. It was very hard to navigate through this project, if it were not for
the help of the amazing mentors at Technica. The dataset was imported from Kaggle.

I was able to use geopandas to pull up a map of the world for me to visualize the data on. After reading the csv, I was able to classify
what shade of purple the hate tweets were supposed to be based on if they were neutral or hate tweets shown in the dataset's "Label" field.
I also had to combine two datasets together, to get the geolocations (longitutdes and latitudes) of the locations on the same datasheet
as the neutrality of the tweet.

This was the final result of the project, with the darker dots being hate speeches and the lighter dots being neutral:
